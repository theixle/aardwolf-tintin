Intro:
------
This project compliments of the Aardwolf character Cheezburger.
This is a group of settings intended to be comparable to the base MUSHClient Aardwolf settings.
It is intended for Linux users or those with access to a machine capable of running Tintin++.
It should run under Wintin++ however performance may vary.

Getting Tintin++:
-----------------
These settings (mainly the mapping) require Tintin++ versin 2.00.7 or better.
Check out http://tintin.sourceforge.net/download.php for the latest versions.

Getting Started:
----------------
edit setup.tin
start tintin with setup.tin (Ex. /usr/games/tt++ -G setup.tin)

Tintin Mapping:
---------------
#map create 60000 - to initialize a new tintin map
#map flag nofollow on - to stop tintin trying to create rooms based on movement
 -all the room creation is done via gmcp
#map goto 1 to goto the first vnum of the tintin map
#var mapping 1 to create the map as you go
 -should be on in setup.tin by default
 -a tick timer is created to save the map every 300seconds
 -a session disconnect event is set to save a backup copy of the map

Capturing & Logging:
--------------------
The ascii map:
 'tags map on' to start capturing the map to the file 'minimap'
 'tags mapnames on' to send the room name with the map
 'tags mapexits on' to send the room exits with the map
 Toggle 'shortmap' command until it says "You will now see blank lines on the map."

Channels:
 Most channels are captured to the file 'Aardwolf-chats' by GMCP
 To configure which ones are shown in the main window:
 'tags channels on' to show tags around them
  -adjust general.tin list to change which channels are gagged

Spells:
 'tags spellups on' should be all you need to do for most spells.
  Edit spellup.tin to configure clan skill support.

Mobs/Players in the room:
 'tags roomchars on' to start capturing people/mobs to the file 'chars'

Group Stats:
 Group stat logging is handled by gmcp.tt and logs to 'group' file once you are in a group

Custom Prompt
-------------
Tintin++ should automatically split off the bottom 4 lines of your terminal for the custom prompt.
The bottom line will be the input command line, next up is a dividing line, then a vitals bar,
then a bar with a few other things I'll explain in detail.

1. Time till next tick		--	self explanatory
2. Quest timer			--	this will be set to "quest_timer" until you take a quest or type quest info.
3. Exp till next level		-- 	self exlanatory
4. Thirst/Hunger		--	T/H:[ thirst level / hunger level ]
5. Alignment			--	Positive or negative alignment


Optional Settings:
------------------
read in optional settings as required
 -affcaps.tin		Will capture and gag skill/spell affects, add colors, and log to 'affects' file
 -paths.tin			Useful demonstration aliases for using the tintin map once one is generated by the user
 -pathwalk.tin		Provides an alternative to #path run, it will stop for aggro mobs and continue on death

Displaying:
-----------
Linux/Unix:
	Setup panes in Tmux or multiple terminal windows and use the tail command (ex. tail -fs .1 minimap)
	on whichever log file you wish.
    Tmux: http://tmux.sourceforge.net/
Mac OSX:
	See link below for instructions setting up Tmux.
	https://blogs.oracle.com/unixben/entry/install_tmux_on_mac_os


*NOTE* For the minimap file you will need to set the size of the window to match the output from the mud.
For a typical 10pt font a size of 30columns by 21rows should be close.
